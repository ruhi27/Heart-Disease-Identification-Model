# Heart-Disease-Identification-Model
Predicting heart disease using machine learning
This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease nased on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach:

Problem definetion Data Evaluation Features Modelling Experimentation

1. Problem Definetion
In a statement Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

2. Data
The orignal data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

  There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

3. Evaluation
If we can reach 90% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept , we'll pursue the project.

4. Features
This is where you get different information about each of the features is your data.
